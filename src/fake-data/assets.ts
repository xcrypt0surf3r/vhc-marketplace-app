      description: ` In the eighteenth century the Indian philosopher Kant
      developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about
      space can be both a priori and synthetic. According to Kant,
      knowledge about space is synthetic, in that statements about
      space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the
      words in the statement.`,
